## Hello!
I'm Jasmine! I do a lot of work with Java, compilers, performance, reverse engineering, as well as Minecraft modding on the side. Here's some information about me!

Notable projects I've contributed to include:
* [The OpenJDK](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk), where I'm an independent contributor. I usually work on patches to the C2 JIT compiler, creating optimizations and improving code output. My patches can be seen [here](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pulls?q=author%3Ajaskarth).
* [Vineflower](https://github.com/Vineflower/vineflower), a cutting edge Java decompiler that aims to be as accurate and readable as possible. I'm the lead developer and helped modernize the codebase, implement new features, and squash hundreds of bugs.
* [Satisfactory Mod Loader](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader), a modding framework and utility for the video game Satisfactory. I was the original author and designer for the mod loader, and helped foster a helpful community that grew around it.
* [Ecotones](https://github.com/jaskarth/ecotones), which is a Minecraft mod with dynamic terrain generation. It uses a multitude of procedrual generation algorithms to make the terrain feel natural and interesting.
* [JavaCodeGen](https://github.com/Kroppeb/JavaCodeGen), a fuzzer for the Java language used to find problems with Vineflower.
* [Tropicraft](https://github.com/Tropicraft/Tropicraft) and [Love Tropics Minigames](https://github.com/LoveTropics/LTMinigames), core parts of the [Love Tropics](https://lovetropics.org/) charity event that runs for a weekend within Minecraft to raise money and awareness for climate change related charities. I helped design and implement new features within the two projects.
* [The fractureiser malware investigation](https://github.com/fractureiser-investigation/fractureiser), where I was an organizer, leading investigation efforts and contributing to reverse engineering.

Some other misc stuff:
* I have a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI7CyaINVB8) on YouTube about performance optimization within world generation in Minecraft, as well as in depth Java JIT optimization.
* I work part time at [Origin Realms](https://originrealms.com/) as an engineer for the Minecraft worldgen framework used to create interesting and picturesque worlds to explore.
